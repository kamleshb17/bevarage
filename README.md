This program has been able to compute the total price of the order placed.

We are the owners of a beverage factory which serves a variety of drinks, juices etc to the customers from its pre-defined set of menu Items.
We offer the customers a choice to customize their drinks in case they want to avoid some specific ingredients from their drinks,
e.g. a person ordering "Chai Latte" which has ingredients as "tea leaves, milk, water, sugar, condiments" a person can order a chai latter without sugar and condiments.

The order value is recalculated based on the actual price of the menu minus the price of the removed ingredient.
